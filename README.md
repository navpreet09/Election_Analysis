## Election Audit Summary
Python has been used to automate election audit results. This can be a great approach to do election audit for future as same code can be used to extract information of own interest. This can be used to get the winner, percentage by which winner won, number of candidates, which county they won from. Code can be manipulated to extract desired results from given data.
- This script can be used again by changing variable names which match the dataset given to analyst. 
- This can also be used to create list of any dataset which need analysis.
